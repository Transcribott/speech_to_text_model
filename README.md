# speech_to_text_model
System requirement : GPU RTX 3060 and above
notebook 1 : speech-to-text-model.ipynb
     -the files contains a deep learning neural network to make a model that converts the speech to words function 
     -data preprocessing and training the model and savings checkpoints
     -to get better and optimised result the number of epoches should not be less than 40 
     
notebook 2 : speech-transcriptIon.ipynb
     -the file contains the model that is trained in notebook 1 
     -raw data is preprocessed and then passed to the model for evaluation of model 
     -the audio transcripts are saved in a file
